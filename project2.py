'''project description:
The service you will implement is a simple Restaurant Finder Service. 
We will use many simplifying assumptions in this project to make life easier.
We will work on the simple 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,
using Euclidean distances to simplify our world.
You will build the core functionality for our LBS for the city of Gridbourne. 
The city of Gridbourne has 100 neighbourhoods, each cell in this grid is a 
neighbourhood and has a name. The name is created using a simple 
mechanism as described below. Note that there are exactly 100 cells, 
and the naming of the cells follow this 10Ã—10 layout;
i.e., A1 to A10 on the first row, B1 to B10 on the second row, 
and so on up until J1 to J10. Not all names are shown in the figure above for 
the brevity of the example.
