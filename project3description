group
A group of cards in the form of a list, each element of which is a 2-character string with the value (drawn from '234567890JQKA') followed by the suit (drawn from 'SHDC'), e.g. ['2C', '2S', '2H'] represents a group of three cards, made up of the Two of Clubs, the Two of Spades, and the Two of Hearts.
The function should return one of the following values, indicating the type of group of cards contained in group:

1
A set of three cards of the same value, e.g. ['2C', '2S', '2H'] represents a set of three Twos. Note that the set may include Wilds, but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
2
A set of 7 cards of the same suit, e.g. ['2C', '2C', '4C', 'KC', '9C', 'AH', 'JC'] represents a set of seven Clubs. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild card), which define the suit. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
3
A set of four cards of the same value, e.g. ['4H', '4S', 'AC', '4C'] represents a set of four Fours. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value. Note also that the sequence of the cards is not significant for this group type.
4
A run of eight cards, e.g. ['4H', '5S', 'AC', '7C', '8H', 'AH', '0S', 'JC'] represents a run of eight cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Six and the Ace of Hearts standing in for a Nine), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards). Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that ['4H', '5S', 'AC', '8H', '7C', 'AH', '0S', 'JC'], e.g., is not a valid run of eight, as it is not in sequence.
5
A run of four cards of the same colour, e.g. ['4H', '5D', 'AC', '7H'] represents a run of four Red cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Red Six), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the colour. Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that ['4H', '5D', '7H', 'AC'] is not a valid run of four cards of the same colour, as it is not in sequence.
None
Any combination of cards which does not correspond to one of the above group types (e.g. ['4H', '5D', '7C', 'AC'].

phase
A combination of card groups in the form of a list of lists of cards, where each card is a 2-character string with the value (drawn from '234567890JQKA') followed by the suit (drawn from 'SHDC'), e.g. [['2C', '2S', '2H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH']] represents an instance of two sets of three cards of the same value, as it is made up of two groups, each of which is a set of three cards of the same value.
The function should return one of the following values, indicating the type of the combination of card groups contained in phase:

1
Two sets of three cards of the same value, e.g. [['2C', '2S', '2H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH']] represents a set of three Twos and three Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value.
2
One set of 7 cards of the same suit, e.g. [['2C', '2C', '4C', 'KC', '9C', 'AH', 'JC']] represents a single set of seven Clubs. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the suit.
3
Two sets of four cards of the same value, e.g. [['4H', '4S', 'AC', '4C'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH', 'AC']] represents a set of four Fours and a set of four Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the two Aces of Clubs and Ace of Hearts), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the value.
4
One run of eight cards, e.g. [['4H', '5S', 'AC', '7C', '8H', 'AH', '0S', 'JC']] represents a single run of eight cards. Note that the set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Six and the Ace of Hearts standing in for a Nine), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards). Note also that the sequence of the cards is significant for this group type, and that [['4H', '5S', 'AC', '8H', '7C', 'AH', '0S', 'JC']], e.g., is not a valid instance of this phase type, as the run is not in sequence.
5
A run of four cards of the same colour and a set of four cards of the same value, e.g. [['4H', '5D', 'AC', '7H'], ['7H', '7C', 'AH', 'AS']] represents a run of four Red cards and a set of four Sevens. Note that each set may include Wilds (as we see in our example, with the Ace of Clubs standing in for a Red Six, and Ace of Hearts and Ace of Spaces standing in for Sevens), but must include at least two "natural" cards (i.e. non-Wild cards), which define the colour/value. Note also that the sequence of the cards within the run is significant for this group type, and also that the sequence of the two groups is significant, in that the run must come before the set of four.
None
Any combination of groups of cards which does not correspond to one of the above phase types (e.g. [['4H', '5D', '7C', 'AC'], ['AC', 'AS', 'AS']].
